## CHRISTMAS EVENT ANALYSIS

### Introduction
For 2023 christmas, sweettooth confectionaries had decided it was going to bring more fun to children and more traction to herself. A unique christmas event; "Dreamland" was organized. Children would need tickets to access the christmas dreamland. The aim of this project was to evaluate the performance of the event and outline specific cause of shortcomings and as well state clearly measures of improvements in subsequet christmas events. 
 
### Basic goals of the project
* Investigating effective ticket sales pattern as well as the effects of the ticket types.
* To identify which age group(which particular audience) were more interested in the event.
* To inquire if there exist any relationship between event's activities and ticket sales. 
* Inquiring the impacts of collaborations on the event.
  
### Actionable results
* Tickets were sold online and in the store. Online ticket sales for this event was about 14% of total ticket sales, while the remaining 86% was sold on evnt ground. Late and inefficient advertising may be some of the reasons for the low online sales. While measures to do better subsequntly should be in place, it have been established to expect more ticket sales on the event ground.
* The event tickets was sold in two categories on the basis of age; 0-5years and 5years and above. Out of the 155 tickets sold on the event ground, 102 was for children of 0-5years while the remaining 53 was for children older than 5. Two possible reasons for this; parents with children below 5years found it more easy to purchase the tickets because it cost 7000 naira only on show days while children above 5 had to pay 15000 naira. Secondly, children and parents probably didn't prioritize seeing santa(which was one of the highlights of the event) at their older age.
* The event's activities can be broadly divided into two; indoor and outdoor events. Indoor events such as paint 'n' sip, baking in Mrs. Clauses kitchen amd seeing Santa Claus mostly interested children between 0-5years old. Outdoor event such as movietime, magic performances and fire eaters would interest adolescents and adults more. The conclusion here is that there was little activities on the event schedule for children around the ages of 5-13years old.
* To further spice up the event, the organisation collaborated with some external vendors that are into activities such as face painting, virtual reality(VR) etc. The fact that majority of people who got the VR tickets was between 5-13years old butresses the immediate point made above. On the impacts, the sales data in the attached dashboard shows that although these external entertainment vendors entertained children, it wasnt quite economically beneficial to the organisation.

## Data Collection and Cleaning
The event was for 12 days. Sales records was entered daily in an orgarnized structure. No much cleaning needed to be done. Data was however restructured appropraitely for ease of analysis. 

## Data Analysis and Vizualization
This analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel utilizing pivot tables, statistical functions and other relevant Excel functions. The vizualization was done with Microsoft Power BI.
